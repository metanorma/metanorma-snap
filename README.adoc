== Purpose

The Metanorma snap package is a self-contained package that includes all the
dependencies required to run Metanorma. It is designed to be easy to install
and use, and it provides a consistent environment for running Metanorma
across different Linux distributions.

The Metanorma executable provided in the snap package is the released executable
from https://github.com/metanorma/packed-mn[packed-mn], which is
https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-cli[metanorma-cli] compiled via
https://github.com/tamatebako/tebako[Tebako].


== What is Snapcraft?

Snapcraft is a tool to build, package and distribute software for Linux
distributions. It is a cross-platform package manager that allows developers
to create and distribute software packages that can run on any Linux
distribution that supports the snap format.


== Installation

The released Metanorma snap package is located at Snapcraft:
https://snapcraft.io/metanorma[Metanorma snap].


== Decisions

* The packages are built using `ubuntu-24.04` (amd64) and `ubuntu-24.04-arm` (arm64).

* The default Ubuntu plantuml package is not used since it severely outdated
from 2020. The Metanorma snap package bundles a latest version of PlantUML.

* The `plantuml` command is actually a wrapper (`scripts/plantuml`) as the OpenJDK
packaged in snap leads to a hardcoded path with the architecture code in there
(`amd64` or `arm64`) yet the `command:` key in snapcraft.yml does not support
the `on {amd64|arm64}` pattern as supported by the `source:` key and the
`*-packages:` keys. The workaround therefore is to provide a wrapper that uses
`java` which is provided through the snapcraft `layouts:` key which performs a
mapping between the host system and the snap package, to make the arch-specific
OpenJDK path available as `java` in an arch-independent way.
+
NOTE: The tip to use a wrapper for OpenJDK path independence is inspired by
the
https://github.com/diddlesnaps/makemkv/blob/68151f33210b0190e41d4cca9ad0ba75afaafe0f/snap/snapcraft.yaml#L106[MakeMKV snap package]
where an executable wrapper is used to wrap a Java program.
+
NOTE: The tip to use layouts to create an arch-independent Java path (thank you!) is inspired by the
https://github.com/diddlesnaps/makemkv/blob/68151f33210b0190e41d4cca9ad0ba75afaafe0f/snap/snapcraft.yaml#L23[MakeMKV snap package]
by https://github.com/diddlesnaps[diddlesnaps] and the
https://github.com/canonical/snapcraft/blob/dacb9c70238041e7c7f7e5bb9ba4ba530b466b1f/docs/how-to/extensions/expand-extensions.rst?plain=1#L21["Expand extensions" article]
which demonstrates that the `SNAP_*`/`CRAFT_*` environment variables are
accessible in the `layouts:` paths.



== Building the package

On Linux:

[source,sh]
----
# Enter the root directory of this repo
snapcraft snap
----

Via Docker:

WARNING: This is not working on macOS.

[source,sh]
----
docker run --rm -it --privileged -v $PWD:/data -w /data ghcr.io/canonical/snapcraft-container:core24
----

NOTE: Snapcraft relies on `snapd` which requires privileged containers.

== Testing the package

If you are on macOS you can install snap to any of your multipass instances with:

[source,sh]
----
multipass transfer metanorma_*_amd64.snap ${instance-name}:/home/multipass
multipass shell ${instance-name}
sudo snap install --devmode metanorma_*_amd64.snap
----

After this the snap is ready to use.

=== Testing uninstallation

Execute the following command to uninstall LaTeXML.

[source,sh]
----
sudo snap remove metanorma
----

After executing the uninstall ensure that the `metanorma` executable is no
longer found.

You can also try running `metanorma help` from the command-line to see if it is
still installed.


== Generating the snapcraft token

We use the https://github.com/canonical/action-publish[canonical/action-publish]
GitHub Actions workflow to publish our snaps.

Every so often, we need to update the token used to publish the snap as the old
one expires.

Run the following Docker command to obtain credentials:

[source,sh]
----
$ docker run -it snapcore/snapcraft:stable snapcraft export-login -
----

You will be prompted to enter your email and password.

[source,sh]
----
$ docker run -v $PWD:/export -it snapcore/snapcraft:stable snapcraft export-login \
  --snaps=metanorma \
  --acls package_access,package_push,package_update,package_release \
  /export/exported.txt

WARNING: The requested image's platform (linux/amd64) does not match the
detected host platform (linux/arm64/v8) and no specific platform was requested
Enter your Ubuntu One e-mail address and password.

Email: metanorma@ribose.com
Password:

We strongly recommend enabling multi-factor authentication: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSO/FAQs/2FA

Login successfully exported to '/export/exported.txt'. This can now be used with

    snapcraft login --with /export/exported.txt

to log in to this account with no password and have these
capabilities:

This exported login is not encrypted. Do not commit it to version control!

Then on your own machine, run the following command to read the file:

[source,sh]
----
$ cat exported.txt
[login.ubuntu.com]
macaroon = AABBB...
unbound_discharge = AABBB...
email = metanorma@ribose.com
----

NOTE: In this repository, the exported login `AABBB...==` value is placed in
GitHub Actions' secret named `METANORMA_SNAPCRAFT_TOKEN`.


== Release workflow (`main.yml`)

This repository uses GitHub Actions workflows to automate the building and
releasing of snap packages to different channels.

The main workflow automatically handles releases based on git events:

* **Main branch pushes**: Automatically releases to the `edge` channel for
  the `main` branch and `vx.y.zpre`
* **Version tags**: Automatically releases to both `candidate` and `stable`
  channels for production use for `vx.y.z`

The workflow follows Snapcraft best practices by uploading the snap package once
to the candidate/edge channel, then promoting the same revision to the stable
channel using the `snapcraft release` command.


== Manual promotion

=== General

For cases where you need to promote an existing revision to the stable channel
without rebuilding, use the manual promotion workflow.

=== Finding revision numbers

To find available revision numbers, you can:

* Check the output of previous workflow runs in the GitHub Actions logs
* Use the Snapcraft dashboard at https://snapcraft.io/metanorma/releases
* Run the following command locally (requires snapcraft login):

[source,sh]
----
snapcraft login --with /export/exported.txt
snapcraft list-revisions metanorma
----


=== Manually promoting a version to stable using the workflow

. Navigate to the GitHub Actions tab in the repository
. Select the "promote-to-stable" workflow
. Click "Run workflow"
. Enter the revision number you want to promote to stable
. Click "Run workflow" to execute

[example]
====
To promote revision 42 to stable:

. Go to https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-snap/actions
. Click on "promote-to-stable" workflow
. Click "Run workflow" button
. Enter `42` in the revision field
. Click "Run workflow"
====


=== Manually promoting revisions

For cases where you need to promote an existing revision to the stable channel
without rebuilding, run the following local commands (e.g. through Docker).

[source,sh]
----
snapcraft login --with /export/exported.txt
snapcraft release metanorma <revision> stable
----


=== Use cases for manual promotion

The manual promotion workflow is useful for:

* **Hotfix scenarios**: Promote a specific tested revision without waiting for
  the full build pipeline
* **Rollback**: Promote an older revision back to stable if issues are
  discovered
* **Recovery**: When automated promotion fails and needs manual intervention
* **Testing**: Promote specific revisions for validation purposes
